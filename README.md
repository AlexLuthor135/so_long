## WHAT IS THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT?

The goal of the project is to create your own game by using an MLX library
which gives you an arsenal of functions which help you create your first
videogame.

## WHAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT?

The difficulty of the project lies in learning algorithms of path-finding,
which are many. In my case, I ended up making somewhat of an algorithm of
my own, which I called "Plague spread", though it may have some similarities
with Flood fill, but I haven't studied Flood Fill enough to be able to compare
both the methods.
